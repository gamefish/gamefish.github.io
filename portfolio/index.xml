      <description>To play this game  Put and keep your finger in the circle.  When the blade drops, release your finger as soon as possible to evade it.  In 2 Fingers or 3 Fingers mode, you need to put 2 or 3 fingers to fill all circles, and the blade will drops one by one, which will be really big challenge for you.
CAUTION: Do NOT play this game on hard floor or high place, you may drop your iPhone/iPod to the ground!</description>
