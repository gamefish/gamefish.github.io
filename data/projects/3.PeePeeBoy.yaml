Pee Pee Boy is one of the most fun and silly game in AppStore that will test your reflexes.

### How to play

The gameplay is simple,help the young boy cleanly pee, without his, well “thingy” getting pinched while doing so. Pinched by what? The falling toilet seat.
The way this is accomplished is by touching the boy and holding your touch until the seat falls, then you must let go to avoid the pinch. But, beware, if you let go too early, the boy pees all over himself and you lose.

### Hint:

  If you feel so hard to escape, concentrate on the dropping sound of the toilet seat.

### Put you name on various leader boards


- Pee - How much you peed in a single game.

- Total Peed - How much you peed in all time.

- Total Pinched - The more you get pinched, the higher you get ranked. Loss may turn into a gain.

- Pee per Pinch - Showcase your reflex and pee skill! Pee most while get pinched least!"
